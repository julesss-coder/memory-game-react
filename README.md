# Memory Game

A simple memory game with React.

The images are taken from NetNinja's course "Build websites with React and Firebase".

The app is the result of my building the app on my own and then watching the course videos to see where I went wrong.

## Setup
The Front End Dev setup I used for this app is taken from Brad Traversy's "Webpack 5 Crash Course".
I followed along and built the setup in order to get a better understanding of Webpack.

Setup includes:
- Webpack setup
- Webpack Dev Server
- HTML Webpack Plugin
- Sass Compiling
- Babel Transpiling
- Asset Resource Loaders
- Analyzer Plugin
- Source Maps
